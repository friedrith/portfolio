        <p>
          With over 12 years of experience in web development, I build web
          products from early prototypes to production-ready applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          My preferred stack includes React and Node.js, styled with Tailwind
          CSS or MUI. I frequently work with frameworks like Next.js and Remix
          (React Router v7 + Vite) to deliver fast, modern experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          I focus on delivering new features through fast-paced
          iterations—without compromising user experience or code quality. I
          design scalable architectures tailored to your project’s stage and
          long-term goals.
        </p>

        <p>
          I can also set up projects with support for feature flags,
          accessibility testing, A/B testing, and localization—ensuring your
          product is ready to grow and adapt.
